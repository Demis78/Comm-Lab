# Course Description
Communications Lab is a production based course that surveys various technologies including web development, sound, 2D design, digital imaging, video, effects and animation. The forms and uses of these communications technologies are explored in a laboratory context of experimentation, collaboration, and discussion. Much of class time will be spent introducing and playing with equipment and software essential to media production and contemporary storytelling. Each technology is examined as a tool that can be employed and utilized in a variety of situations and experiences. The world wide web will serve as the primary environment for content delivery and user-interaction. Principles of interpersonal communications and media theory are also introduced with an emphasis on storytelling fundamentals, user-Â­centered design, and interactivity. Outside of the classroom, students will work both individually and in assigned groups on a variety of assignments. Each student will be expected to complete weekly homework exercises, 5 major assignments, and one final web portfolio project.
